Prince Aldric:
        "My father is cursed by some dark magic, I have to be by his side, can you please seek out the Elixir of Life."
        "The elixir! My father is cured! Thankyou!"
        "I wish I can kill the bastard that did this to my father!"
Elvira:
        "Return to me if you ever need healing."
        "You're looking much healthier now."
        "Oh its a lovely day!"
Garth:
        "Find the Amulet of Vitality, across the river to the west."
        "Find the Sword of Strength - cross the river and back, on the east side."
        "Find the Tome of Agility, in the Land of Shadows."
        "You have found all the treasure I know of."
        "Good Day to you Sir!"
